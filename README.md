# Breast Cancer Classication
## Bayesian Statistical Analysis on Imbalanced Dataset

 In the field of medical diagnostics, accurate classification models play a critical role in identifying diseases early and effectively. For example, breast cancer classification presents a unique problem due to its imbalanced nature. Malignant cases are significantly outnumbered by benign cases - the benign to malignant ratio among breast biopsies is believed to be around 4:1 or 5:1. Traditional machine learning approaches tend to struggle with imbalanced data, as they produce biased predictions that favor the majority class (benign tumors). This leads to reduced sensitivity in detecting the minority class (malignant tumors), which can have serious medical consequences.

 Frequentist methods often handle imbalanced data through techniques such as oversampling minority
 classes, undersampling majority classes, or adjusting class weights. Bayesian modeling approaches offer another promising solution by incorporating prior knowledge into the model parameters, which can help prevent bias and overfitting from the majority class data.

 This report explores the application of Bayesian classification methods, specifically Bayesian Logistic
 Regression, in the context of handling an imbalanced breast cancer diagnosis dataset. By analyzing
 this approach, this may determine whether Bayesian models can enhance diagnostic accuracy and
 mitigate the adverse effects of class imbalance in classification tasks.
